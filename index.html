			<h1> Obstacles I Faced </h1>
			<hr> 

			<div class="text-div">
				<h3> Button not terminating loop </h3>
				<p> At the time, the program had only two buttons; one for starting the autoclicker and one for ending it. I initially had no multithreading implemented at this point; so when the program began running, it was stuck in an infinite loop once the start button was clicked.

				
				<p> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27662408/stopping-and-starting-a-loop-with-
				a-button"> THIS </a> stackoverflow thread confirmed my suspicion. The fact that the program was stuck in a loop, while not being multi-threaded, meant that the event dispatching thread would not be activated. To combat this, I simply created another thread and added my infinite loop which clicks there. This solved my issue and also ensured that I didn't modify the the GUI, as Swing is not thread safe. </p> 
			</div>

			<div class="text-div">
				<h3> Making specific key stop program </h3>
				<p> I am currently having difficulty finding a way to end the program via pressing a key, while the program is not focused. Apparently this is not possible, however I'm still researching this.
